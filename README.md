# Image-recognition
## Image Recognition API
API Purpose: Build an API that can recognize and classify images (e.g., animals, objects, or text).
 ## Key Learning Points:
Use a Java machine learning library like Deep Java Library (DJL) or integrate with TensorFlow for Java.
Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images using a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, Inception).
Implement RESTful endpoints that accept image uploads and return classification results (e.g., object labels and confidence scores).
Additional Features: Add support for multiple image formats and batch processing. You could also integrate it with an image processing library like OpenCV to handle image pre-processing (e.g., resizing, normalization).
